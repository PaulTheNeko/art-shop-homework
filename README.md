# Just some homework

We didn't have a specific kind of site specified for our assignment, so I'm making this.

I'll (try to, but probably forget) to use this file to document the reasoning of some of the decisions I'll make in this project for future reference.
I'm doing this both because it could be useful, and with the hope that if I sound smart enough in the readme I'll get a good grade.
As a bonus I may get some much needed writing practice.

I'm starting using the Svelte framework, as I've heard good things about it.
In particular, it seems to compile your JS to surgically (and _efficiently_) modify the DOM, rather than providing runtime in-browser library to detect when modifications should be made.

While I didn't research other frameworks, I want to mention that React would have been my second choice.I've heard of it being functional, which is a paradigm I really respect.

I am also using Sveltekit, as that seems to be the recommended way (or at least a good way) to make a Svelte project.
